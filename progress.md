## P0.5 — Repository skeleton + progress.md — STATUS: ✅ done
Date: 2026-05-06
Operator: Mukul Phogat

What got built:
- Directory tree per playbook minus `.github/workflows/` (`docs/decisions/`, `docs/perf/`, `infrastructure/ecs/`, `src/main/java/com/childcarewow/calendar/`, `src/main/resources/db/migration/`, `src/test/java/com/childcarewow/calendar/`)
- `docs/runbook.md` placeholder (sections owned by future Parts noted in TODO comments)
- `progress.md` (this file): hand-off-report template + backfilled entries for P0.0 through P0.4

Files changed (count: 8):
- `progress.md` (new) — hand-off log
- `docs/runbook.md` (new) — operations procedures placeholder
- `docs/decisions/.gitkeep` (new)
- `docs/perf/.gitkeep` (new)
- `infrastructure/ecs/.gitkeep` (new)
- `src/main/java/com/childcarewow/calendar/.gitkeep` (new)
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/.gitkeep` (new)
- `src/test/java/com/childcarewow/calendar/.gitkeep` (new)

**Skipped:** `.github/workflows/.gitkeep` — GitHub's API rejects pushes that touch `.github/workflows/*` unless the auth token has `workflow` scope. Our `gh auth` token has `repo` + `admin:org` + `read:org` only. Rather than refresh scope just for a placeholder file (an interactive browser flow), the dir is left uncreated; **P0.6 (CI workflow) will be the first PR that creates `.github/workflows/`**, and the operator runs `gh auth refresh -s workflow` once before that PR can push.

Validation:
- [x] Directory tree exists, checked into `main` (verified via `git ls-tree --name-only -r main`)
- [x] `progress.md` exists with template
- [x] `README.md` exists (from P0.4)
- [~] *Playbook validation #4 ("test PR cannot be merged without approval") DOES NOT APPLY* — branch protection was loosened to 0 approvals during P0.4 since the operator is solo dev and can't approve own PRs. Direct push to main, force-push, and deletion are still blocked; `enforce_admins=true`.

Notes / surprises:
- Branch protection deviation: `required_approving_review_count=0`. Tighten to 1+ when team has multiple reviewers. The deviation is explicit + documented; PR flow itself is enforced (PRs #1–#4 demonstrate it).
- All backfilled entries for prior Parts are concise summaries; full conversational context lives in CLAUDE.md §0 of the parent `Events_CCW` repo plus the session log of 2026-05-06.

Next part: Series 0 / **Part 0.1 — Maven + Spring Boot scaffold**. (Naming collision: pre-flight "P0.1" was the AWS step; Series-0 "Part 0.1" is the Maven scaffold. See `implementation_plan.md` "Pre-flight execution order" callout.)

---

## P0.3 — Firebase project (push notifications, D4) — STATUS: ✅ done
Date: 2026-05-06
Operator: Mukul Phogat

What got built:
- GCP project `ccw-cal-dev-a911f` with Firebase added (free Spark plan)
- Firebase Admin SDK service account `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@ccw-cal-dev-a911f.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Service-account JSON key (created via `gcloud iam service-accounts keys create`) uploaded to LocalStack secret `childcarewow-calendar/dev/firebase-service-account`
- FCM API + Firebase Management API enabled

Files changed (count: 0 in this repo; 1 in parent Events_CCW repo, uncommitted):
- `Events_CCW/implementation_plan.md` — P0.3 free-tier execution variant callout

Validation:
- [x] `client_email` ends in `iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- [x] FCM API enabled (also: firebase, firebasehosting, firebaseinstallations, firebaseremoteconfig)
- [x] Firebase project metadata reachable via Management API
- [ ] Test push to a device token — DEFERRED to Series 11.6 per playbook step 5

Notes / surprises:
- Free-tier variant Option A: only `ccw-cal-dev` Firebase created. `ccw-cal-stg` deferred (Series 7+), `ccw-cal-prod` deferred (Series 11+). Free-tier callout added to `implementation_plan.md`.
- Firebase ToS click-through (one-time, not scriptable) was required. Operator accepted via the Firebase console "Add project" wizard.
- Console wizard auto-created a *new* GCP project (`ccw-cal-dev-a911f`, random suffix) instead of attaching to the empty `ccw-cal-dev` shell created earlier via `gcloud projects create`. The empty shell was deleted (`gcloud projects delete ccw-cal-dev`; recoverable for 30 days).
- Project ID has a random suffix because GCP project IDs are global; `ccw-cal-dev` was already used (by our deleted shell).
- Service-account JSON private key never appeared in conversation history (uploaded via `file://` reference; only `client_email`/`project_id`/`type` echoed for validation).
- Google Cloud SDK was installed during this Part.

Next part: P0.5

## P0.2 — Supabase project (Auth + Storage, D1/D4) — STATUS: ✅ done
Date: 2026-05-06
Operator: Mukul Phogat

What got built:
- Supabase project `ccw-cal-dev` (project ref `xedxxrfuwbyqtxrqearx`), hosted free tier, region `us-east-1`
- Storage bucket `event-attachments` (public, 10 MB cap, MIME allowlist `image/jpeg`+`image/png`)
- ES256 JWKS published at `/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`
- `site_url` + `uri_allow_list` set to `http://localhost:5173` (frontend Vite dev server)
- Service-role key + JWT config saved to LocalStack secrets `childcarewow-calendar/dev/supabase-service-role` and `…/supabase-jwt-public-key`

Files changed (count: 1 in parent Events_CCW repo, uncommitted):
- `Events_CCW/implementation_plan.md` — P0.2 free-tier execution variant callout

Validation:
- [x] `/auth/v1/health` endpoint reachable
- [x] JWKS reachable, ES256 P-256 key
- [x] Both Supabase secrets present in LocalStack with version IDs
- [x] `event-attachments` bucket exists with correct config (10485760 byte limit, jpeg+png allowlist)

Notes / surprises:
- Free-tier variant Option A: only `ccw-cal-dev` created. Free tier caps at 2 projects/org; reserves slot 2 for staging when needed.
- Project uses ES256 (asymmetric JWKS) — backend will validate JWTs via the JWKS URL, not via a shared HS256 secret.
- Supabase API returned both legacy JWT keys (long HS256 JWTs, type=legacy) AND new `sb_publishable_*`/`sb_secret_*` format keys. The `sb_secret_` key is masked in API responses after creation. Backend uses the legacy `service_role` JWT for now.
- Supabase Personal Access Token (PAT) was used for project creation. **Operator should revoke the PAT** at https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens since it appeared in conversation history.
- DB password generated random 32-char and not persisted (we don't use Supabase Postgres — calendar DB is on AWS RDS per D6).

Next part: P0.3

## P0.1 — AWS account + IAM bootstrap — STATUS: ✅ done (LocalStack edition)
Date: 2026-05-06
Operator: Mukul Phogat

What got built:
- LocalStack 3.8 (community) container via `docker compose up -d localstack`, persistence volume
- IAM user `calendar-operator` + access keys
- IAM policy `CalendarBackendOperator` (committed as `infrastructure/iam/operator-policy.json`) attached to the user
- 15 Secrets Manager placeholders at `childcarewow-calendar/{dev,staging,prod}/{db-credentials,supabase-jwt-public-key,supabase-service-role,firebase-service-account,smtp}`
- Idempotent `infrastructure/localstack/bootstrap.sh` that supports both LocalStack mode (default, via `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`) and real-AWS mode (when `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` is unset)

Files changed (count: 4 across 3 PRs):
- `docker-compose.yml` (new, PR #1; image pin to `:3.8` in PR #2) — LocalStack service
- `infrastructure/iam/operator-policy.json` (new, PR #1) — `CalendarBackendOperator` policy spec (least-privilege per playbook step 3, with tag-scoped RDS, role-prefix-scoped IAM, subdomain-scoped Route53)
- `infrastructure/localstack/bootstrap.sh` (new, PR #1; `cygpath` fix in PR #3) — provisioner
- `README.md` (modified, PR #1) — LocalStack run-locally section

Validation:
- [x] `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile childcarewow-calendar` returns mock identity
- [x] `iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name calendar-operator` shows exactly `CalendarBackendOperator`
- [x] 15 secrets present matching `childcarewow-calendar/*` prefix
- [ ] OIDC role `ChildcareWowCalendarGitHubActions` — DEFERRED to Series 11 (real AWS only; GitHub Actions runners can't reach localhost:4566)

Notes / surprises:
- All AWS replaced by LocalStack 3.8 community. Real AWS deferred to Series 11. ECS, ECR, RDS, ELB are LocalStack Pro-only and unavailable in our setup; that's fine for P0.1 scope.
- `localstack/localstack:latest` now resolves to a Pro-licensed dev image (`2026.5.0.dev67`) that exits without `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`. Pinned to `:3.8` (last known-good community 3.x).
- Step 5 (GitHub OIDC provider + role) and step 7 (`AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` repo variable) deferred to Series 11.
- Windows Git Bash + native AWS CLI: `--policy-document file:///c/...` paths fail; bootstrap.sh uses `cygpath` to convert to Windows-style.
- AWS CLI v2.34.43 installed during this Part (deferred from P0.0 per memory `backend_p00_deferred_installs.md`).

Next part: P0.2

## P0.4 — GitHub repository — STATUS: ✅ done (with deviations)
Date: 2026-05-06
Operator: Mukul Phogat

What got built:
- Public GitHub repo at https://github.com/mukul29phogat-art/calendar-backend
- Initial commit: `README.md` + `.gitignore` (Java + Maven + Spring Boot) on `main`
- Branch protection rule on `main`: PR required, dismiss stale reviews, no force-push, no deletion, `enforce_admins=true`. Approvals first set to 1, later loosened to 0 (deviation; see notes).
- Actions workflow permissions: `default_workflow_permissions=write`, `can_approve_pull_request_reviews=false`

Files changed (count: 2 in initial commit; 4 total across PRs #1–#3 once P0.1 lands):
- `README.md` (new) — repo overview + namespace-transfer note
- `.gitignore` (new) — Java + Maven + Spring Boot template

Validation:
- [x] `gh repo view` returns `name=calendar-backend`, `visibility=PUBLIC`
- [x] `git push origin main` works without auth prompts (gh-managed credential)
- [x] `gh api repos/.../branches/main/protection` returns the protection rules
- [ ] `gh variable list` shows `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` — DEFERRED to Series 11 (P0.1 step 7)

Notes / surprises:
- **Namespace deviation:** operator does not have access to the `ChildcareWow` GitHub org. Repo lives in personal namespace `mukul29phogat-art/calendar-backend`. **Cleanup TODO at org access:** `gh repo transfer mukul29phogat-art/calendar-backend childcarewow`, then update IAM OIDC trust-policy `sub` claim to `repo:childcarewow/calendar-backend:*`.
- **Visibility deviation:** `PUBLIC` instead of `PRIVATE`. GitHub gates branch protection (classic + rulesets) behind GitHub Pro for private personal repos. Public was the only $0 path to enable branch protection.
- **Approvals deviation:** loosened from 1 → 0 because the solo operator can't approve own PRs (GitHub disallows self-review). Tighten when there are multiple reviewers.

Next part: P0.1

## P0.0 — Local toolchain — STATUS: ✅ done
Date: 2026-05-06
Operator: Mukul Phogat

What got built (on operator workstation, not in this repo):
- Eclipse Temurin 21 JDK (LTS) at `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot`
- WSL 2.6.3 (Windows feature enabled, post-reboot)
- Docker Desktop 4.71 (`docker` 29.4.1, `docker compose` v5.1.3)
- jq 1.8.1
- Already present: Maven, Git, Node, npm, curl, gh
- Installed during P0.1: AWS CLI v2.34.43
- Installed during P0.3: Google Cloud SDK
- *Still deferred:* psql client (deferred to Series 0 / Part 0.2 per memory `backend_p00_deferred_installs.md`)

Files changed (count: 0 in this repo)

Validation:
- [x] `java -version` — Temurin 21
- [x] `docker --version` — 29.4.1
- [x] `docker compose version` — v5.1.3
- [x] `aws --version` — 2.34.43 (post-P0.1)
- [x] `gcloud --version` — installed (post-P0.3)

Notes / surprises:
- WSL2 install required a reboot — one session boundary (CLAUDE.md §0 was used to hand off state).
- Docker installer initially failed because a leftover `C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop` directory was owned by a non-admin user account. Fixed via elevated `takeown /F ... /R /D Y; Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` then reinstall.
- Docker Desktop install required UAC accept; same for AWS CLI and Google Cloud SDK installs in later Parts.
- AWS CLI + Google Cloud SDK don't appear on this Bash session's PATH because they were installed mid-session; new shells pick them up via the system PATH update. Workaround: prepend `C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Cloud SDK\google-cloud-sdk\bin`, and `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin` to PATH.

Next part: P0.4
